# ONLINE-PARKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

The Online Parking Management System developed using Eclipse and MySQL offers a comprehensive solution for efficient parking management. It includes features such as user authentication (login, signup, forget password), real-time slot availability tracking, vehicle entry and exit management, and admin functionalities. Upon login, users are presented with a menu displaying options like viewing parking history, checking current slot availability, entering a new vehicle, or exiting a parked vehicle. The history page displays details of parked vehicles including name, vehicle number, slot number, entry and exit time, along with vehicle type identification through images. The slot availability page dynamically updates button colors to indicate available slots for 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers. Admin login allows access to rate management, viewing current parked vehicles, and generating summaries for parked vehicles categorized by vehicle type.
